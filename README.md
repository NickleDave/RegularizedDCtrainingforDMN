# Regularized_D-Ctraining_for_DMN
Regularized divide and conquer training for dendrite morphological neurons

This repository is the implementation of the article on "Regularized Divide and Conquer Training for Dendrite Morphological Neurons", E. Zamora, H. Sossa, 2016. 

Please cite it if you intend to use this code. 

This package contains functions that fit a probabilistic linear regression model. For the ordinary regularized linear regression, user has to manually assign the regularization parameter. However, here we provide methods to automatically determine proper parameter from the data. Two methods have been used to determine the regularization parameter: one uses the EM algorithm, the other uses the Mackay fix point update method. There are also demos and docs in this package. 
This package is now a part of the PRML Toolbox 

Installation
It is not needed. Just download files where you want and run "demo" on Matlab R2015a or later.
