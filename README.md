# Regularized divide and conquer training for dendrite morphological neurons

This package contains functions to train dendrite morphological neurons based on the paper "Regularized Divide and Conquer Training for Dendrite Morphological Neurons", E. Zamora, H. Sossa, 2016. This method is effective to overcome overfitting in classification problems for machine learning.

# Installation and Demo
It is not needed. Just download files where you want and run "demo_for_training" on Matlab R2015a or later.

[Coming soon...a video for a briefly explanation of the training algorithm YouTube]

# Experiments
You can reproduce the experimental results of the paper by running "main_DatasetsTraining.m" to reproduce experimental results in each dataset. The files "RegularizedCurves_for_E0.m" and "RegularizedCurves_for_L0.m" generate the regularized curves for tolerated error E0 and depth limit L0, respectively. 

Please see the code for further details.
