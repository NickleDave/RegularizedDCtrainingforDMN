# Regularized divide and conquer training for dendrite morphological neurons

This package contains functions to train dendrite morphological neurons based on the paper "Regularized Divide and Conquer Training for Dendrite Morphological Neurons", E. Zamora, H. Sossa, 2016. It is an effective technique to solve classification problems for machine learning. 

Please cite it if you intend to use this code. 

# Installation and Demo
It is not needed. Just download files where you want and run "demo_for_training" on Matlab R2015a or later.

See the video for a briefly explanation of training algorithm YouTube

# Experiments
You can reproduce the experimental results for the paper. 
Run ".m" to 
Run ".m" to generate the regularized curves 
Run "..m" to generate the reguralrized curves 

Please see the code for further details.
